Would you like me to make a **Zoom tutorial web page** (with screenshots and animation) for your blog *Learning Sutras*?  
It could teach beginners interactively — with sections for joining, hosting, and screen sharing.

---

**User:**  
I want to teach computer programming on YouTube using Zoom.  
We will have me teaching and 1 or 2 students interacting.  
My screen will be shared.

**Assistant:**  
That’s an **excellent setup, Shubham 👨‍🏫** — using **Zoom + YouTube** for live programming lessons is simple, powerful, and professional-looking.  

Here’s a **step-by-step guide** to make your Zoom classes look and sound great on YouTube 👇  

---

## 🎬 1. **Overall Setup**

### You’ll Need:
- **Laptop/Desktop** with good mic and webcam  
- **Zoom account** (Pro not required)  
- **YouTube account** with *Live Streaming enabled*  
- (Optional) **OBS Studio** — to stream Zoom directly to YouTube with layouts  

---

## ⚙️ 2. **Zoom Settings for Teaching Programming**

### 🔧 Before the Class:
Open **Zoom Settings → Video & Audio → Advanced:**
- ✅ Check **“Enable HD”** under video  
- ✅ Turn on **Original Sound for Musicians** under audio (for clear voice)  
- ✅ Disable **Echo Cancellation** if using earphones  
- ✅ Mute all participants on entry  
- ✅ Enable **“Spotlight me”** — so your video stays primary  

---

## 💻 3. **Sharing Your Screen (for Coding)**

While teaching code:
- Click **Share Screen → Advanced → Portion of Screen** if you want to show code + your face.
- OR **Share Window** if you only want to show VS Code, PyCharm, or your browser.
- ✅ Turn on **Share Computer Sound** if you’re playing videos or explaining with audio.  
- Use **Annotate** to mark parts of the code (highlight syntax or errors).

💡 **Pro Tip:**  
Use a **dark theme editor** (like VS Code Dark+) — it’s easier on viewers’ eyes and looks great on camera.

---

## 🧑‍🎓 4. **Students Interaction (1–2 learners)**

Invite students via **Zoom link**:
- Keep **“Waiting Room” ON** (you decide who joins).  
- Pin or Spotlight student videos when they speak.  
- Ask them to keep mics muted until needed.  
- They can share their screen for code review (if allowed).

You’ll appear as the main speaker while coding — clean and distraction-free.

---

## 📡 5. **Streaming Zoom to YouTube**

### Option A — Direct from Zoom (simple)
If you have a **Zoom Pro** or higher:
1. Go to **Zoom Web Portal → Settings → In Meeting (Advanced)**.  
2. Enable **Allow Live Streaming** and select **YouTube**.  
3. During a meeting, click **More → Live on YouTube**.  
4. Choose your channel → set title/description → click **Go Live!**

That’s it — your **Zoom session is live on YouTube**.

---

### Option B — Using OBS (best for control & layout)
If you want overlays, titles, or both faces side by side:
1. Install [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/).  
2. Add a **Window Capture** → select your Zoom window.  
3. Add **Audio Input Capture** (your mic).  
4. Add **Display Capture** (your code editor).  
5. Use **Studio Mode** to preview before going live.  
6. In OBS → **Settings → Stream → YouTube / Custom RTMP**.  
7. Paste your **YouTube Stream Key** from YouTube Studio → Go Live.

✅ You can then switch between:
- Your face full screen  
- Code screen  
- Split layout (you + students)  

---

## 🎤 6. **Audio Setup (Very Important)**

To make your voice clear:
- Use **wired earphones with mic** (not Bluetooth).  
- In Zoom:  
  - Turn off “Automatically adjust mic volume”.  
  - Keep mic input at ~70%.  
- Record a 1-minute test and listen before going live.

---

## 📷 7. **Camera Setup**

If you have a webcam:
- Place it slightly above your eye level.  
- Ensure good lighting — face a window or use a ring light.  
- Keep a clean, coding-themed background (or virtual background).  

---

## 📁 8. **Recording & Uploading**

- You can record the Zoom session (`Alt + R`) while streaming.
- Save it as `.mp4` → edit (trim intro/outro) → upload to YouTube.
- Add timestamps and code links in the description.

---

## 🌐 9. **Tips for a Professional Look**

- Create a **YouTube thumbnail** with your topic (e.g., “Python Loops Explained Live”).  
- Add background music before class starts (muted once you begin).  
- Ask students to keep chat questions short — you can read them aloud.  
- Save chat transcript for reference.

---

## 🚀 10. **Example Workflow for a Live Class**

| Step | Task |
|------|------|
| 🕐 10 mins before | Open Zoom, test mic, camera, and screen share |
| 🧑‍🏫 Start class | Introduce topic, greet students |
| 💻 10–30 mins | Explain theory + show code in VS Code |
| 💬 10 mins | Let students share screen / ask questions |
| 🎯 5 mins | Recap and announce next topic |
| 📦 After class | End stream, save recording, upload replay |

If you’d like, I can create a **custom teaching setup diagram** (showing how Zoom connects to OBS → YouTube, your mic → PC → stream, etc.)  
Would you like me to generate that visual next?
